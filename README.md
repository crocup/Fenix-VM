## About

**Vulnerability Management** is an ongoing process aimed at taking an inventory of the entire infrastructure, researching it to identify and prioritizing vulnerabilities and fixing identified deficiencies. It is an evolution of the conventional vulnerability scanner, an improved process designed to dramatically improve the security of an organization. 

**Fenix VM** allows you to obtain an objective assessment of the security state of the information system,
detect and eliminate vulnerabilities in advance, automate the process of monitoring compliance with regulatory requirements in the Republic of Belarus 

## Possible
- Automatic discovery of assets on the network (Inventory)
- Identification of important assets
- Daily automatic scans of important assets
- Identification and prioritization of vulnerabilities and exploits **(in development)**
- Daily report on the state of infrastructure security
- Immediate notification (telegram, email) of the system administrator: about the discovery or change of assets in the network, the discovery of new vulnerabilities, the emergence of new exploits for the discovered vulnerabilities
- Periodic reminder of the need to eliminate critical vulnerabilities (if not eliminated within 2 days) **(in development)**
- Monitoring compliance with the requirements of the regulator in the Republic of Belarus **(under development)** 
## Warning
This is a development version, we don't recommend its use in production!

**Pre-release of the first beta version at the end of June 2021**
