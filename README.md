## About
**Vulnerability Management** is an ongoing process aimed at taking an inventory of the entire infrastructure, researching it to identify and prioritizing vulnerabilities and fixing identified deficiencies. It is an evolution of the conventional vulnerability scanner, an improved process designed to dramatically improve the security of an organization.
**Fenix VM** allows you to obtain an objective assessment of the security state of the information system,
detect and eliminate vulnerabilities in advance, automate the process of monitoring compliance with regulatory requirements in the Republic of Belarus

## Possible
- Continuous monitoring of the organization's infrastructure through automatic network inventory
- Identification and daily automatic scanning of important assets in the network, aimed at timely response
when vulnerabilities are found;
- Daily automatic scanning for the visibility of important assets
- Identification and prioritization of discovered vulnerabilities and exploits. Achieved through the use of the analytics module included in the software product **(in development)**
- Control of elimination of vulnerabilities
- Daily report on the state of infrastructure security
- Immediate notification (telegram, e-mail) to the system administrator: about the discovery or change of assets in the network, the discovery of new vulnerabilities, the emergence of new exploits for the discovered vulnerabilities
- Periodic reminder of the need to eliminate critical vulnerabilities (if not eliminated within 2 days) **(in development)**
- Monitoring compliance with regulatory requirements in the **Republic of Belarus** **(under development)**
- Assessment of the security status of the information system. Comprehensive assessment of the state of protection depending on the presence of vulnerabilities found in critical assets. The analytics module is used. **(in developing)** 

## Warning
